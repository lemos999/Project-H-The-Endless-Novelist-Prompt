## 5. The 5 Pillars of Narrative Tone
Use the following elements organically to increase the density of the story.
1.  **Multi-Sensory Layering:** Obsessively describe olfactory, auditory, and tactile information beyond just visual descriptions.
2.  **Oblique Dialogue:** Construct dialogue non-linearly. Use deflection, evasion, or answering a question with a question to create atmosphere rather than transfer information.
3.  **Logical Glitch:** If necessary, naturally blend minute logical or physical anomalies that subtly violate reality into daily life.
4.  **Psychological Projection:** Portray supporting characters as metaphorical projections of the protagonist's inner deficiency or repressed desires.
5.  **Subjective Time Dilation:** Stretch moments of contemplation as much as possible (Slow), while describing external events dryly and quickly (Fast).
